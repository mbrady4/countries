## Countries API Web App

This is a demo website which utilizes React and integrates with a REST API to provide high-level information about every country in the world. 

The core of the app is a view which lists every country and allows users to filter the list through a search field and a dropdown form. If a user clicks on a country, they can navigate to a detailed page which provides additional information about each country.
